This tutorial will guide you how to write an activity post.

## Naming and Path

Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION`{: .filepath} and put it in the `_posts`{: .filepath} of the root directory. Please note that the `EXTENSION`{: .filepath} must be one of `md`{: .filepath} and `markdown`{: .filepath}. 

## Front Matter

Basically, you need to fill the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) as below at the top of the post:

```
---
title: TITLE
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [CATEGORIE] or [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]
tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase
---
```

### Timezone of Date

In order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the `timezone` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} but also provide the post's timezone in variable `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `+0800`.

### Categories and Tags

The `categories` of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity. For instance:

```
---
categories: [Animal, Insect]
tags: [bee]
---
```

## Mathematics

For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won't be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:

```
---
math: true
---
```

After enabling the mathematical feature, you can add math equations with the following syntax: 

- **Block math** should be added with `$$ math $$` with **mandatory** blank lines before and after `$$`
- **Inline math** (in lines) should be added with `$$ math $$` without any blank line before or after `$$`
- **Inline math** (in lists) should be added with `\$$ math $$`

```
<!-- Block math, keep all blank lines -->

$$
LaTeX_math_expression
$$

<!-- Inline math in lines, NO blank lines -->

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, $$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ consectetur adipiscing elit."

<!-- Inline math in lists, escape the first `$` -->

1. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
2. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
3. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
```


## Images

### Caption

Add italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:

```
![img-description](/path/to/image)
_Image Caption_
```

### Size

In order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.

```
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="700" height="400" }
```

> For an SVG, you have to at least specify its _width_, otherwise it won't be rendered.

Starting from _Chirpy v5.0.0_, `height` and `width` support abbreviations (`height` → `h`, `width` → `w`). The following example has the same effect as the above:

```
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w="700" h="400" }
```

### Position

By default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes `normal`, `left`, and `right`.

> Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.

- **Normal position**

  Image will be left aligned in below sample:

  ```
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }
  ```

- **Float to the left**

  ```
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }
  ```

- **Float to the right**

  ```
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }
  ```


### Image Path

When a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:

```
---
img_path: /assets/img/activities
---
```

And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:

```
![The figure](figures.png)
```

The output will be:

```
<img src="/assets/img/activities/figures.png" alt="The flower">
```

### Preview Image

If you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of `1200 x 630`. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet `1.91 : 1`, the image will be scaled and cropped.

Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image's attribute:

```
---
image:
  path: /path/to/image
  alt: image alternative text
---
```

Note that the [`img_path`](#image-path) can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the  attribute `path` only needs the image file name.

For simple use, you can also just use `image` to define the path.

```
---
image: /path/to/image
---
```

## Prompts

There are several types of prompts: `tip`, `info`, `warning`, and `danger`. They can be generated by adding the class `prompt-{type}` to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type `info` as follows:

```
> Example line for prompt.
{: .prompt-info }
```
{: .nolineno }

## Syntax

### Inline Code

```
`inline code part`
```

### Filepath Hightlight

```
`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}
```

### Code Block

Markdown symbols ```` ``` ```` can easily create a code block as follows:

````
```
This is a plaintext code snippet.
```
````

#### Specifying Language

Using ```` ```{language} ```` you will get a code block with syntax highlight:

````markdown
```yaml
key: value
```
````

#### Line Number

By default, all languages except `plaintext`, `console`, and `terminal` will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class `nolineno` to it:

````markdown
```shell
echo 'No more line numbers!'
```
{: .nolineno }
````

#### Specifying the Filename

You may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute `file` to achieve this:

````
```shell
# content
```
{: file="path/to/file" }
````
