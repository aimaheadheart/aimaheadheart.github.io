## Project

AIM-AHEAD: <https://www.aim-ahead.net/>

## Project description:

This project aims to reduce health disparities in heart transplantation among underrepresented minority populations, particularly Blacks, by investigating the role of donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch, specifically the underrepresentation of blood type B donors. We will use advanced AI/ML methodologies to analyze the potential benefits of increasing blood type B donors and identify trends contributing to these disparities.

Our aims are:

1. Develop AI/ML algorithms to estimate the potential benefits of increasing blood type B donors for heart transplantation in Black patients, providing evidence for education and community engagement initiatives.
2. Collaborate with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to study donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch in the context of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and engage communities to promote our AI/ML findings, encouraging more blood type B donors.

By focusing on donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch and employing AI/ML models, this project aims to improve fairness in heart transplant procedures and overall cardiometabolic health for underrepresented minority populations. The project's success will provide insights into the role of donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch in heart transplantation disparities and inform the development of targeted interventions and policies.
