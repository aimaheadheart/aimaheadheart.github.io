The National Alliance Against Disparities in Patient Health (NADPH) partnered with Fisk University to host a hybrid (in-person and online) roundtable discussion with faculty researchers, health care and policy practitioners, and community leaders to discuss the realities and hype surrounding AI/ML use in health research.

The panel discussion was moderated by Rachele Hendricks-Sturrup, DHSc, MSc, MA, at the NADPH, functioning within (NIH) AIM-AHEAD's Infrastructure Core and co-chairing AIM-AHEAD's Ethics and Equity Workgroup.
