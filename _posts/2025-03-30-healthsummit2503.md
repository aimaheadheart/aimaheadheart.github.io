A Health Summit for a unique opportunity to learn, share, and engage with leaders in A.I. and healthcare — in partnership with the community!

Hosted at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church and welcoming over 200 participants, this summit was designed not just for scholars, but for everyone.

Unlike academic conferences, this event was grounded in community partnership and outreach. Sessions focused on real-world topics including generative AI, healthcare access, heart failure, and responsible AI governance — all with practical implications for daily life.

Interactive poster sessions and community focused group dialogues have shaped the summit’s outreach strategy, ensuring the content speaks directly to local needs.

## Event Details:
+ Date: March 29, 2025
