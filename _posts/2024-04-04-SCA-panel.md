## Session Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the medical field, including perioperative cardiovascular medicine. Understanding the basics of AI, its advantages and pitfalls, and how to utilize the best technology to advance our clinical practice and research and ensure healthcare equity is paramount for SCA members. Our panel consists of experts in medical AI research and political science. We aim to highlight the impact of AI in healthcare, principles and guidelines to develop equitable AI research approaches, and some of the current successful AI research in cardiovascular medicine aiming to improve healthcare disparity.

## Learning Objectives
Attendees will leave the panel with a comprehensive understanding of:

+ Understand generative artificial intelligence opportunities and challenges in healthcare

+ Understand the need for an AI Bill of Rights to ensure equitable healthcare

+ Know the Key principles, guidelines, and strategies for developing equitable and ethical AI/machine learning algorithms

+ How to achieve sustainable success in AI/machine learning health equity education and research through interdisciplinary, innovative, and inclusive approaches.
