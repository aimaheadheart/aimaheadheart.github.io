Join the Health Summit for a unique opportunity to learn, share, and engage with leaders in A.I. and healthcare — in partnership with the community!

Hosted at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church and welcoming over 200 participants, this summit is designed not just for scholars, but for everyone.

Unlike academic conferences, this event is grounded in community partnership and outreach. Sessions will focus on real-world topics including generative AI, healthcare access, heart failure, and responsible AI governance — all with practical implications for daily life.

Interactive poster sessions and community focus group dialogues have shaped the summit’s outreach strategy, ensuring the content speaks directly to local needs.

Come be part of a movement where cutting-edge technology meets compassionate community care.
