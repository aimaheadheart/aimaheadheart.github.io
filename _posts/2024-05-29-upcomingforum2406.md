We cordially invite you to participate in a community-driven forum focused on “Community Voices: The Impact of AI on Health Equity in Underserved Communities: Potentials, Concerns, and Challenges.”  A Luncheon Forum hosted by the TU DICB AIM AHEAD project to convene local government officials, healthcare practitioners, community influencers, health advocates, and academic representatives to engage in dialogue on pivotal issues such as AI's impact on healthcare and biomedical research. The forum will provide a platform for discussing community concerns regarding AI and health, including racial bias, privacy, health disparities, workforce development, infrastructure, and access within rural settings, particularly concerning underrepresented minority communities and vulnerable populations. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by rural communities in embracing and benefiting from AI technologies in healthcare and biomedical research, our gathering will seek to address these challenges collaboratively, ensuring that no segment of our community is marginalized in the technological landscape. Your expertise and insights are invaluable to this discourse, and we sincerely hope you can join us.
