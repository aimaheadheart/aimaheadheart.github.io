    <h2>Project description</h2>
    <p>This project aims to improve outcomes in heart transplantation by examining donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch, with particular attention to the availability of blood type B donors. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies, we aim to quantify the potential benefits of increasing the supply of blood type B donors and to provide data-driven insights that can inform public education, community engagement, and healthcare planning.</p>

    <p>Our aims are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Develop AI/ML algorithms to estimate the potential benefits of increasing blood type B donors for heart transplantation, providing evidence for education and community engagement initiatives.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with communities and institutions to study donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch in the context of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and engage communities to promote our AI/ML findings, encouraging more blood type B donors.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>By focusing on donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch and employing AI/ML models, this project aims to improve fairness in heart transplant procedures and overall cardiometabolic health for populations. The project's success will provide insights into the role of donor-recipient blood type composition mismatch in heart transplantation disparities and inform the development of targeted interventions and policies.</p>
